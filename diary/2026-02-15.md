# Development Diary - 2026-02-15

## Project Takeover
Taking ownership of the CBB Matchup Analyzer. Goals:
1. Build self-improving pick tracking system
2. Enhance model accuracy through data-driven iteration
3. Create user-facing dashboard for pick consumption

## Infrastructure Setup
- Created `diary/` for daily logs
- Creating `picks_history/` for bet tracking
- Setting up SQLite database for pick performance

## Model Status (Baseline)
Current model features:
- Possession-based efficiency (SOS-adjusted)
- 30-day recency weighting (exponential decay)
- Logistic win probability (k=0.175)
- Safety ranking (60% win prob, 25% edge, 15% preferred range)

**Hypothesis for improvement:**
- 30-day half-life might be too slow for in-season form changes
- Need to track actual picks vs. outcomes to validate model edge
- Line shopping across books is working well

## Today's Analysis
Running 2026-02-15 slate...

### First Run Issues
- Initial analysis run killed by SIGKILL (likely timeout/resource limit)
- Dependencies installed successfully (streamlit, pandas, scipy, plotly, etc.)
- API key provided: using The Odds API for real-time lines
- Root cause identified: ESPN scraping takes 40s per team (2600s for 64 teams)

### Solutions Implemented (Evening)

**1. Automatic Result Scraper** (`result_scraper.py`)
- Fetches completed games from NCAA API
- Calculates win/loss/push for spread/total/moneyline bets
- Updates pick database automatically
- Closes the feedback loop for self-improvement

**2. Parallel Cache Builder** (`parallel_cache_builder.py`)
- Concurrent team data fetching (4 workers)
- Reduces 43 min → ~10 min for full day cache
- Estimates completion time upfront
- Graceful error handling per team

**3. GitHub Integration**
- PAT configured, pushing to branch `agent/infrastructure-setup`
- Git identity: "Domo (OpenClaw Agent)"
- Commits tracked in project history

**4. Cron & Heartbeat Setup**
- Daily analysis job: 8 AM EST
- Heartbeat tasks: cache warming, git commits, result checking
- Next run: 2026-02-16 08:00 EST

### Performance Baseline
- Model: Possession-based efficiency with SOS adjustment
- No historical picks yet (first run)
- Need 30+ picks to establish confidence in edge calculation
