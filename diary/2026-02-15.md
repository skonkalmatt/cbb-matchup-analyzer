# Development Diary - 2026-02-15

## Project Takeover
Taking ownership of the CBB Matchup Analyzer. Goals:
1. Build self-improving pick tracking system
2. Enhance model accuracy through data-driven iteration
3. Create user-facing dashboard for pick consumption

## Infrastructure Setup
- Created `diary/` for daily logs
- Creating `picks_history/` for bet tracking
- Setting up SQLite database for pick performance

## Model Status (Baseline)
Current model features:
- Possession-based efficiency (SOS-adjusted)
- 30-day recency weighting (exponential decay)
- Logistic win probability (k=0.175)
- Safety ranking (60% win prob, 25% edge, 15% preferred range)

**Hypothesis for improvement:**
- 30-day half-life might be too slow for in-season form changes
- Need to track actual picks vs. outcomes to validate model edge
- Line shopping across books is working well

## Today's Analysis
Running 2026-02-15 slate...

### First Run Issues
- Initial analysis run killed by SIGKILL (likely timeout/resource limit)
- Dependencies installed successfully (streamlit, pandas, scipy, plotly, etc.)
- API key provided: using The Odds API for real-time lines
- Investigating hang - might be NCAA API or ESPN data fetching
